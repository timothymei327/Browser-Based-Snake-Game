### _Description_

This is a simple browser-based version of the classic arcade game, Snake. The player will be able to control the direction of the snake with arrow keys and as more dots are collected, the snake will grow longer incrementally. The player wins after filling up the game board with the snake; or loses if the snake collides with itself or the borders of the game board.
